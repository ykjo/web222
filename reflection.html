                Throughout the development of variety of mobile devices, creating multiple versions of website is in fact considered to be inefficient and costly. Currently there are so many types of devices used by people on a daily basis. Just to list a few; there are desktop PC laptop, tablet, and smartphones. Users on a personal computer or laptop are able to make the web window bigger or smaller according to their preferences. To adapt and optimize towards different devices’ resolution and pixel sizes, a Responsive Web Design was introduced to web programming world.            </p>
            <p>
                Responsive Web Design is a concept that designs and develops websites, with the intention of providing flexibility based on the user’s device, platform, and style. Responsive Web Design is a crucial factor that needs to be taken into consideration, as there are approximately seven billion mobile users in the world. Users are very likely to be exposed to online advertisement through internet access on their mobile devices. According to research on consumer spending behaviors, 55 percent of users makes purchases after seeing a product from an online marketing. It is Responsive Web Design that ultimately builds upon a good experience for consumers while browsing for potential items to shop. Moreover, the responsive design also has impact on the developer as well. The issues revolving around user experience can be solved by having dual-version website for PC and mobile in most cases. However this will require developers to maintain and update two different websites all the time. In comparison to managing just one version of the website on a PC, it will be more time consuming and it cannot be optimized for all devices. Nevertheless by utilizing Responsive Design, the developers can be more efficient with their time while building a website that is optimized and flexible for all devices.            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, having a responsive web design improves the overall online appearance and visibility. Google is one of the most popular search engines and its algorithm supports website with responsive web design. Having a responsive design gives a competitive edge, as presentation is important and having a higher visibility will help gain a larger audience of views.            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the responsive web design is in fact essential for web developers for an improved user experience and optimized work process. As aforementioned above, the benefits include saving time, money, and resources in developing a website. By doing this research, I have learned that having responsive web design is much more advanced and efficient than having multiple versions of websites. In the future, I will keep in mind and use this knowledge for my own web projects. Finally, this course has taught me the basics of web programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages have allowed me to gain insight to how websites work and function. It was an interesting experience to learn how the languages work together to achieve finalized website. Before learning in this course, I had no knowledge in regards to front-end language, and now I can say that I do have the knowledge to start a front-end project.
